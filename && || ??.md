# Short Circuiting (&& and ||)

Logical operators use ANY data type, and return ANY data type.

<strong>Reminder:</strong> these are the falsy values:

- false (Boolean)
- 0 (Number data type)
- "" (empty string)
- 'null'
- 'undefined'
- NaN (not a number)

## ||

Returns the <strong>first truthy value</strong>.

Short-circuit evaluation with || is useful for setting default values:

```
const restaurant = {
  name: "Jade Palace",
  numSeats: 38,
  currentCustomers: 0,
  openingHours: {
    fri: {
      open: 10,
      close: 17,
    },
    sat: {
      open: 11,
      close: 20,
    },
    sun: {
      open: 9,
      close: 15,
    },
  },
};

const totalGuests = restaurant.numSeats || 25
const customers = restaurant.currentCustomers || 10
```

This would return `totalGuests = 38` as `restaurant.numSeats` exists in the restaurant object therefore is truthy and returns `38`. If the restaurant object did not have a `numSeats` property, the first truthy value will be 25 and totalGuests would equal 25.

If there are NO truthy values, the last expression / value is returned (even if it is falsy).

The only exception to this, is when the value is deliberately set to `0` like for `restaurant.currentCustomers`. `0` evaluates as a falsy value therefore `customers = 0 `. When coming across this case, we use the 'Nullish Coalescing Operator' (??).
<br><br>

## &&

Returns the <strong>first falsy value</strong>.

If there are NO falsy values, the last expression / value is returned (even if it is truthy).

We can use the && operator to execute code in the second operand if the first operand is true.
<br><br>

## || (Nullish Coalescing Operator)

Works the same as the || operator, except it works with nullish values, instead of falsy values (i.e. it returns the <strong>first nullish value</strong>).

Nullish values:

- 'null'
- 'undefined'

<strong>(NOT 0 or "")</strong>

```
const restaurant = {
    name: "Jade Palace",
    numSeats: 0,
    currentCustomers: 0,
}

const customers = restaurant.currentCustomers ?? 10
```

In the above example, customers now returns as `0` as intended.

## Optional Chaining (?.)

Typically paired with the above operators, optional chaining is used to check if properties exist. This is particularly useful for nested objects with many optional properties.

If a property does not exist ''undefined'' is returned.

Typically we would have used an 'if' statement to check if a property exists, e.g. :

```
if (restaurant.openingHours.sat.close) {
    console.log(restaurant.openingHours.sat.close)
}
```

However, this only checks for the nested `close` property in `restaurant.openingHours.sat`, and if `openingHours` or `sat` did not exist, this would throw an error. However, If we were to also check if `openingHours` or `sat` exists with this method, this would require multiple if statements.

Optional chaining allows this to be done all at once:

```
console.log(restaurant.openingHours?.sat?.close)
```

Pairing this with the above operators:

```
openFrom = restaurant.openingHours?.fri?.open ?? "closed"
```

If restaurant is open on Friday, it will publish the opening time, else it will return `closed`.
