# Short Circuiting (&& and ||)

Logical operators use ANY data type, and return ANY data type.

<strong>Reminder:</strong> these are the falsy values:

- false (Boolean)
- 0 (Number data type)
- "" (empty string)
- 'null'
- 'undefined'
- NaN (not a number)

## ||

Returns the <strong>first truthy value</strong>.

Short-circuit evaluation with || is useful for setting default values:

```
const restaurant = {
    name: "Jade Palace",
    numSeats: 38,
    currentCustomers: 0,
}

const totalGuests = restaurant.numSeats || 25
const customers = restaurant.currentCustomers || 10
```

This would return `totalGuests = 38` as `restaurant.numSeats` exists in the restaurant object therefore is truthy and returns `38`. If the restaurant object did not have a `numSeats` property, the first truthy value will be 25 and totalGuests would equal 25.

If there are NO truthy values, the last expression / value is returned (even if it is falsy).

The only exception to this, is when the value is deliberately set to `0` like for `restaurant.currentCustomers`. `0` evaluates as a falsy value therefore `customers = 0 `. When coming across this case, we use the 'Nullish Coalescing Operator' (??).

## &&

Returns the <strong>first falsy value</strong>.

If there are NO falsy values, the last expression / value is returned (even if it is truthy).

We can use the && operator to execute code in the second operand if the first operand is true.

## || (Nullish Coalescing Operator)

Works the same as the || operator, except it works with nullish values, instead of falsy values (i.e. it returns the <strong>first nullish value</strong>).

Nullish values:

- 'null'
- 'undefined'

<strong>(NOT 0 or "")</strong>

```
const restaurant = {
    name: "Jade Palace",
    numSeats: 0,
    currentCustomers: 0,
}

const customers = restaurant.currentCustomers ?? 10
```

In the above example, customers now returns as `0` as intended.
