# 'This' Keyword

The 'this' leyword is a special variable created for every function. It takes the value of the "owner" of the function in which the 'this' keyword is used. (More on this soon.) <br>
The value of 'this' is only assigned when the function is <strong>actually called</strong>.

## Rules

<strong> 1. Method </strong> <br>
(Remember that a method is a function attached to an object.) <br> The 'this' keyword inside a method will point to the object <strong>on which the object is called.</strong> (Example below highlights this.)

```
const jordy = {
    firstName: "George";
    birthYear: 1991;
    calcAge:

}

```
