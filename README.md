# Javascript-Notes

These are all the notes taken throughout the Udemy Compelte Javascript Course. These will be created only for my own understanding and any knowledge taken away by others from these notes should be checked against the original content / fact-checked in case they have been misunderstood.

These notes will only cover the areas which the author has deemed useful for later / challenging, which I would benefit from.
