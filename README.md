# Javascript-Notes

These are all the notes taken throughout the Udemy Complete Javascript Course. These will be created only for my own understanding and any knowledge taken away by others from these notes should be checked against the source material / fact-checked in case they have been misunderstood.

These notes will only cover the areas which the author has deemed useful for later or has found challenging, and from which the author will benefit from.
